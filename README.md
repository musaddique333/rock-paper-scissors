## What I Learned 🧠

Throughout the development of this Rock-Paper-Scissors game project, I gained a wealth of knowledge and practical experience, including:

1. **DOM Manipulation** 🖥️: I acquired a deep understanding of Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation, enabling me to interact with and modify web page elements dynamically.

2. **Element Retrieval** 📜: I learned how to efficiently retrieve and manipulate HTML elements from the web page using JavaScript, allowing me to create interactive and responsive features.

3. **Dynamic Font Sizing** 📏: I mastered the art of dynamically adjusting font sizes using viewport units (vw and vh). This skill enhanced the visual appeal and responsiveness of the game across various screen sizes.

4. **Keyframe Animations** 🎆: I delved into the world of keyframe animations in CSS, enabling me to create eye-catching animations and transitions that added a level of engagement and excitement to the user experience.

5. **CSS-in-JS** 🎨: I explored the technique of writing CSS within JavaScript for HTML elements, giving me greater control and flexibility in styling and theming the game's components.

6. **Original JavaScript Logic** 🚀: One of the most valuable takeaways from this project is the ability to create the entire game logic from scratch in JavaScript. Every aspect, from user interactions to determining the game's outcome, was designed and implemented by me, demonstrating my capability to independently develop complex software systems.

This project has not only honed my front-end development skills but has also instilled in me a deep appreciation for the creativity and problem-solving that goes into crafting an engaging web-based application.

By creating this Rock-Paper-Scissors game from the ground up, I've expanded my expertise and confirmed my proficiency in web development. This experience has been instrumental in my journey to becoming a proficient developer in the world of interactive web applications.
